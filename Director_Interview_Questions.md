# Tell me about yourself?
I'm someone who takes the responsibility of my work very seriously. Being a naturally decisive and inspirational leader, I belive the role of Director for your company is one I'll excel in.  
  
# Why do you want to become a Director in our company?
The competencies and skills that I possess include the ability to create a solid vision that everyone understands and adheres to, an ability to get the most of everyone, the desire to create a long time relationship with stakeholders and important clients and also that concious understanding that I need to perform consistently to a very high standard to ensure my organization grows, thrives, and that it also not only meets but exceeds its financial targets.

# How do you plan to succeed as a Director?
First and foremost I do not underestimate the challenge that lies ahead.  
However, I believe the way to succeed in the position of a Directory is based on three core elements:  
  
The first element is ensuring that I have a clear vision of where I need to be, how I intend to get there and within what time frame. Having a vision that is based on clarity and action will always get me there where I need to be.  
  
The second element is being a strong and decisive decision maker who is not afraid to make difficult and sometimes unpopular decisions that are entirely focused on benefitting the organization. Decisions are not about the individuals, but they are about the business and where we all want to be.  
  
The final element is to be an inspirational leader who motivates everyone within the organization to drive fearlessly towards the company objectives.  
  
I'll ensure that all of these three elements are at the core of everything we do, and that is why I believe I'll succeed in this role as a Director.  
  
# How would implement a change within our business?
There are a number of specific steps that I'd follow to implement change within your business:  
  
Firstly I'd define the change that is required and align it to the strategic aims of the company.  
  
I would then determine who the change would impact and how we would need to support them during the change process.  
  
I'd then create a solid plan for achieving the change desired and who would be responsible for meeting the specific milestones of the change process, and by what timeframe.  
  
I'd then determine the communication strategy that would outline how the change will be implemented and communicated throughout the different stages of the process.  
  
I'd actively monitor change process during it's implementation to ensure that there is no divergence from the core objectives of the change.  
  
Finally once the change has been achieved, I'd measure the success of the process and determine what has been learned along the way, so we could continually improve and develop collectively as an organization.  
  
# 3 Great competencies and strengths that'll help you succeed in this Director Role.
The three greatest competencies that I possess that I feel will make a significant impact to your organization are:
* 1. Leadership: I can lead the toughest of teams and individuals and inspire them to achieve the company goals. I'd do this by using strong interpersonal skills that make people feel valued whilst utilizing their strengths and abilities.
* 2. Management: In respect of Management, I'd manage the goals and strategic aims of the organization by delegating them effectively to make sure that every manager that I'm working with, meets his/her objectives that would have been set during the appraisal process. Strong leadership and management must come from the top and be desseminated, not diluted, through the different tiers of the management.    
* 3. Technical Expertise: With my years of technical expertise, I'd be always there to guide and suggest the best approach that needs to be taken to minimise down time and improve the services.
  
# How would you handle a situation where someone in your team has made an error that had a significant negative impact on the organization?
"To be honest, if this type of situation occurs, it is entirely my responsibility. As the Director, I'm responsible for everything that happens under my leadership.  
  
In terms of how I would handle this situation, I'd conduct an investigation to determine what must be done immediately to put things right and to ascertain why the situation occured. I'd then take steps to ensure that this situation does not happen again, including any training that should be conducted and also any changes to the management processess that would need to be made.  
  
As I say, I'd take responsibility for the situation and bear the fallout of what had happened.

# What are your values as company leader?
I have seven important values that I always adhere to as a leader and these are:  
  
* 1. I'll always act with HONESTY and INTEGRITY in everything I do. If I as a leader cannot do this then the same cannot be expected from the staff.  
  
* 2. LEAD BY EXAMPLE.  
  
* 3. ACCOUNTABILITY: As a leader, I'm accountable to you and will always work hard to achieve the company goals and objectives.  

* 4. CONTINIOUS DEVELOPMENT AND IMPROVEMENT of not only myslef, but my team as well. I feel it is important to be open to change and also to inspire your staff to be the best they can be.  
  
* 5. TEAMWORK: As it is not possible to achieve my goals without the support of my team.  
  
* 6. CREATIVENESS AND BEING INNOVATIVE: Whilst I'm a creative leader, I'd constant encourage my team members to be innovative and have the freedom to come up with new ideas, that will benefit the organization.  
     
* 7. COMMITMENT TO PROVIDE EXTRAORDINARY SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS: Without customers there is no business, and they will be core to everything we do, if I'm selected as a Director.
